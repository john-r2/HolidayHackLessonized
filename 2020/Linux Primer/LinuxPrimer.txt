Perform a directory listing of your home directory to find a munchkin and retrieve a lollipop!
elf@bbfa84460562:~$ ls

Now find the munchkin inside the munchkin.
elf@bbfa84460562:~$ cat munchkin_19315479765589239 
(strange that grep -i *munchkin* munchkin_19315479765589239  did not work)

Great, now remove the munchkin in your home directory.
rm munchkin_19315479765589239

Print the present working directory using a command.
pwd

Good job but it looks like another munchkin hid itself in you home directory. Find the hidden munchkin!
ls -la

Excellent, now find the munchkin in your command history.
history

Find the munchkin in your environment variables.
env

Next, head into the workshop.
cd workshop

A munchkin is hiding in one of the workshop toolboxes. Use "grep" while ignoring case to find which toolbox the munchkin is in.
grep -i 'munchkin' *

A munchkin is blocking the lollipop_engine from starting. Run the lollipop_engine binary to retrieve this munchkin.
elf@bbfa84460562:~/workshop$ ls l*
lollipop_engine
elf@bbfa84460562:~/workshop$ chmod +x lollipop_engine 
elf@bbfa84460562:~/workshop$ ./lollipop_engine 
munchkin.898906189498077

elf@bbfa84460562:~/workshop$ cd electrical/
elf@bbfa84460562:~/workshop/electrical$ mv blown_fuse0 fuse0

Now, make a symbolic link (symlink) named fuse1 that points to fuse0
ln -s fuse0 fuse1

Make a copy of fuse1 named fuse2.
cp fuse1 fuse2

We need to make sure munchkins don't come back. Add the characters "MUNCHKIN_REPELLENT" into the file fuse2.
echo "MUNCHKIN_REPELLENT" >> fuse2

Find the munchkin somewhere in /opt/munchkin_den.
elf@bbfa84460562:/opt/munchkin_den$ find . -iname '*munchkin*'

Find the file somewhere in /opt/munchkin_den that is owned by the user munchkin.
elf@bbfa84460562:/opt/munchkin_den$ find . -user munchkin

Find the file created by munchkins that is greater than 108 kilobytes and less than 110 kilobytes located somewhere in /opt/munchkin_den.
 find . -size +108k -size -110k

List running processes to find another munchkin.
ps aux

The 14516_munchkin process is listening on a tcp port. Use a command to have the only listening port display to the screen.
elf@bbfa84460562:/opt/munchkin_den$ netstat -nat
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State

The service listening on port 54321 is an HTTP server. Interact with this server to retrieve the last munchkin.
elf@bbfa84460562:/opt/munchkin_den$ curl 127.0.0.1:54321
munchkin.73180338045875elf@bbfa84460562

Your final task is to stop the 14516_munchkin process to collect the remaining lollipops.
munchkin.73180338045875elf@bbfa84460562:/opt/munchkin_den$ kill 38042

Congratulations, you caught all the munchkins and retrieved all the lollipops!
Type "exit" to close...
