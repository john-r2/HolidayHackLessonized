# this is simply a python implementation of a standard Mersenne Twister PRNG.
# the parameters used, implement the MT19937 variant of the PRNG, based on the
# Mersenne prime 2^19937âˆ’1
# see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister for a very good explanation
# of the math behind this...

# so... guess what! while it isn't necessarily obvious, the
# functioning of the tempering matrix are mathematically
# reversible. this function impliments that...
#
# by using this, we can take the output of the MT PRNG, and turn
# it back into the actual values held within the MT[] array itself
# and therefore, we can "clone" the state of the PRNG from "n"
# generated random numbers...
#
# initially, figuring out the math to do this made my brain hurt.
# simplifying it caused even more pain.
# please don't ask me to explain it...
